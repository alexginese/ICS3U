Repeating your code is inefficient. Also we might not know when it will end:
```JS
// Ask the user to enter a number and check for valid input
let input = Number(prompt(“Enter a number.”));

if (isNaN(input))
  input = Number(prompt(“Please enter a number.”));
    if (isNaN(input))
      input = Number(prompt(“Ugh, please enter a number.”));
        if (isNaN(input))
          input = Number(prompt(“Enter a NUMBER.”));
            if (isNaN(input))
              ... 
```

For this reason, programming languages have the ability to move back up to a specific line in the code.

It's not as simple as saying "go back to line 12", but it's still pretty simple:

![While Look Syntax](https://gist.github.com/assets/25152375/ffd72893-6cad-4af0-b6d6-ae765ca69f25)

**Think of the condition _just like an if-statement_!** The code will loop (repeat) and _continue_ to loop _if_ (or _while_) the condition is `true`. Let's look at some examples:

```JS
// Example: A never-ending loop (not good)
while (true) {
  console.log("You can't stop me!");
}

// Example: Counting to 10
let n = 0;
while (n <= 10) {
  console.log("n is", n);
  n++;  // We need to make sure we modify 'n'!
}

  // Example: Should I stop?
  let input = "n";
  while (input != "y") {
    input = prompt("Should I stop? (y/n)").toLowerCase();
  }
  console.log("Ok, I stopped");
  ```

# Your Turn!

[Back to the lesson](#the-lesson)

Create a new code environment / file in VSCode. (FILE > New Window **or** FILE > Open Folder). I recommend making a new folder called `Unit 3` and this first code file could be `3.1-While.js` or something similar.

The top of your file should have a `header`. Something like this:
```JS
/**
 * 3.1 - While Loops
 * Author: John Smith
 * 
 * Lesson link:  go.brash.ca/3U-3.1-While-Loops
 **/
```

You should also get used to using the `'use strict';` directive at the top of your code (you've seen this in previous assignments).

## Your Task:

Note - if you struggle with the functions below, see your teacher for simpler examples / tasks.

### Create the following three functions:
1. `countdown(start, stop)`: this function will count down from the `start` value to the `stop` value.
  - Check `start` and `stop` to make sure `start > stop`.
    - If not, return -1.
  - When the loop finishes, the function should _return_ the number of times it looped (how many numbers it printed).

    For Example:
    ```txt
    countdown(9, 4)
    9
    8
    7
    6
    5
    4
    6   << That's the return value (only visible if you use console.log())
    ```
<br>

2. `random_until(min, max, stop)`: this function will...
    - check that `max` is _greater_ than `min`. If not, return -1;
    - check that `stop` is between (or equal to) `min` and `max`. If not, return -1;
    - generate a random number from `min` to `max`. Print it to the console. 
      - _Repeat this process as long as the random number is not equal to_ `stop`;
    - return `stop`.

    You're going to need the `randInt()` function. Copy and paste it from here:
    ```JS
    // Return a random integer from min to max (inclusive)
    function randInt(min, max) {
      min = Math.ceil(min);
      max = Math.floor(max);
      return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1) + min);
    }
    ```

<br>

3. `average(n)` - this function asks the user for `n` values and then calculates the average, not rounded. It should behave like this:
   ```txt
   > average(5)
   Please enter value 1/5 > 6
   Please enter value 2/5 > 4
   Please enter value 3/5 > 2
   Please enter value 4/5 > 4
   Please enter value 5/5 > 12
   The average is 5.6
   ```
    It is safe to assume proper input - _no need to check that it's a valid number_.
